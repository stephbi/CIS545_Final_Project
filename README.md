1. CIS545-Final-Project: Using over 1,000,000 datapoints from a Kaggle dataset, this project built an ML model to capture the binary classification problem of whether someone would default on a loan (i.e. when a borrower fails to pay back a lender for loan) based on over 50 factors including credit and borrowing history. All aspects of the data analysis process are followed, including data pre-processing, EDA, and modelling.
