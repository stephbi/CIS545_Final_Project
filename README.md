# CIS545 Final Project Description

1. Using Python: Using over 1,000,000 datapoints from a dataset stored in an AWS S3 bucket and Apache Spark, I built an ML model to capture the binary classification problem of whether someone would default on a loan (i.e. when a borrower fails to pay back a lender for loan) based on over 100 features/factors, with over 98% accuracy. Code includes steps for data pre-processing, EDA (including PCA), and modelling.
