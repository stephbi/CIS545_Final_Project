# AI-ML-Past-Projects

Projects: 

1. Using Python - CIS545-Final-Project: Using over 1,000,000 datapoints from a dataset stored in an AWS S3 bucket and Apache Spark, I built an ML model to capture the binary classification problem of whether someone would default on a loan (i.e. when a borrower fails to pay back a lender for loan) based on over 50 factors including credit and borrowing history with over 98% accuracy. Code includes steps for data pre-processing, EDA (including PCA), and modelling.
